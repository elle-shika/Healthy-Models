    "## Introduction\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast evolving trend in the tech landscape, rapidly changing work and reality as we know them to be. Its creation offers a solution for automating routine tasks of human everyday life and work in order to enhance speed, efficiency and productivity. By virtue of their design, the relevance of artificially intelligent technologies, specifically Large Language Models, spans through all spaces of human involvements, including the indispensable field of healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models such as ChatGPT and Google's BERT are transforming the healthcare landscape by enhancing clinical decision-making, improving documentation, and enabling innovative applications in patient care. This project seeks to explore the incorporation of LLMs, like ChatGPT, into the workflows of health professionals, i.e. doctors and pharmacists, assessing their impact on the utilization of traditional information sources and identifying potential benefits and challenges. By addressing these objectives, the study aims to contribute to the evolving integration of AI technologies in healthcare"
